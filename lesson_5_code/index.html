              So what is motivation, exactly? The author Steven Pressfield has a
              great line in his book, The War of Art, which I think gets at the
              core of motivation. To paraphrase Pressfield, “At some point, the
              pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it.”

              In other words, at some point, it is easier to change than to stay
              the same. It is easier to take action and feel insecure at the gym
              than to sit still and experience self-loathing on the couch. It is
              easier to feel awkward while making the sales call than to feel
              disappointed about your dwindling bank account. Lorem ipsum dolor

          <div class="two-part_text">
            <p>
              During a conversation about writing, my friend Sarah Peck looked
              at me and said, “A lot of people never get around to writing
              because they are always wondering when they are going to write
              next.” You could say the same thing about working out, starting a
              business, creating art, and building most habits.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="two-part_list">
            <ul>
              <li>
                If your workout doesn’t have a time when it usually occurs, then
                each day you’ll wake up thinking, “I hope I feel motivated to
                exercise today.”
              </li>
              <li>
                If your business doesn’t have a system for marketing, then
                you’ll show up at work crossing your fingers that you’ll find a
                way to get the word out (in addition to everything else you have
                to do).
              </li>
              <li>
                If you don’t have a scheduled time when you write every week,
                then you’ll find yourself saying things like, “I just need to
                find the willpower to do it.”

              Imagine you are playing tennis. If you try to play a serious match
              against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. The match
              is too easy. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you try to
              play a serious match against a professional tennis player like
              Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will find yourself
              demotivated for a different reason. The match is too difficult.
            </p>

            Compare these experiences to playing tennis against someone who is
            your equal. As the game progresses, you win a few points and you
            lose a few points. You have a chance of winning the match, but only
            if you really try. Your focus narrows, distractions fade away, and
            you find yourself fully invested in the task at hand.
