    <h1>Free to focus: expert advice on employee distractions and how to remove them</h1>

    <p class="text-headeer">With more of us working from home more often, online security is a bigger concern for businesses than ever. But rather than dramatic attacks from outside sources, <mark>90% of data breaches are actually caused by human error</mark>, says security firm Zivver. Distractions at work (be it at home or the office) are among the factors that create errors that can lead to these data breaches. We asked three experts about the issues that can dent productivity, disrupt employees focus and compromise security – and how to mitigate them.</p>

   <h2 id="link-1">Communications overload</h2>
   <p><span class="tech">Tech companies have come up with multiple tools to help us communicate – but when it comes to focus and productivity, they can hinder as well as help.</span></p>
   <p>“Tech makes communication quicker, more efficient and more accessible, allowing people from all over the world to work together – but its created a lot of distractions along the way,” says business coach and productivity expert Jess Salamanca. “Having multiple tabs open, switching between communication platforms, not knowing how to use these tools correctly … all of these mean people get distracted. It can take up to 23 minutes to refocus on a task after switching from one to another. If you forget your password, or youre struggling to find the right document, your focus can be disrupted – and when that happens multiple times throughout the day, its a lot of time wasted.”</p>
   <div class="fact">
     <p>In fact, a comprehensive multinational survey by Zivver found that an overwhelming 98% of employees want the freedom to focus. To reduce the number of interruptions experienced by employees, cyber-security consultant and chartered security professional James Bore recommends streamlining your tech.</p>

    <h2 id="link-2">Pressure to respond</h2>
    <p>In an age of instant gratification, we all expect speedy responses to our messages. Studies have shown that the most likely reply time to an email is just two minutes, while half of responders will reply within an hour – and with instant communication tools, the pressure to respond quickly can be even greater.</p>
    <div class="quotes">
    <p>“One of the joys of email is that I can send a message, and you can reply when you feel like it,” says Bore. “But when youre looking at platforms that are more real-time, theres an impulse to respond instantly. Its like someone walking up behind you and tapping your shoulder every five minutes.”</p>
  </div>
  <p>Allowing yourself to not get distracted and flustered by new work or emails coming in means your brain stays focused on the task at hand, and youre less likely to make a mistake – such as sending an email to the wrong person because you were thinking about them,” says systems strategist Elle Baldry. “If you give yourself the permission to take your time and do things properly – or ask your employer if its OK to switch off notifications for a period of time so you can work on one thing, rather than 30 at once – youll be happier and more productive.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="link">
    <h2 id="link-3">Security stress</h2>
    <p>Ironically, worrying about security protocols can be distracting enough in itself to cause mistakes – especially in workplaces where multiple tools mean multiple processes to remember.</p>
    <p>To combat the fear factor, employers should make sure theyre protecting their systems from human error, with a secure communications platform such as Zivver, and supporting staff in its usage – especially if they make mistakes (<span class="color">and 62% of employees surveyed admit to making recent email errors</span>).</p>
   </div>

   <div class="link">
    <h2 id="link-4">Overwork</h2>
    <p>Mistakes due to human error are often due to being overloaded and having tight deadlines, which mean people simply dont have the time to give their jobs and security protocols the level of focus they deserve.</p>
    <div class="add">
    <p>Baldry adds: “If Im rushing and on the go, my autofill takes over and people get gobbledygook from me. Its also easy to attach the wrong document or copy the wrong person into an email because youre typing the first three letters of their name, your software is automatically picking a person out of your address book, and you dont have time to check it.”</p>
    <p>If employees are complaining that they dont have time to focus on security, it might be a sign that theyre overworked.</p>

   <div class="link">
    <h2 id="link-5">Inadequate tools</h2>
    <p>Communication tools that arent fit for purpose could also compel employees to use unapproved third-party sites that do a better job, which could be another cause of unintended data leaks.</p>
    <p>Bore adds: “For example, forcing people to use unapproved transfer sites to send large documents because your email doesnt cater for them is a big security risk. But using tools such as Zivver, which prevents data leaks like these – properly deployed and managed by a security team – will make a big difference.”</p>
